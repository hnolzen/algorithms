# Algorithms collection

This repository contains a collection of algorithms, data structures and programming exercises. 

### Motivation
With this project I would like to improve my knowledge of algorithms and data structures. 

### Approach
I will start to add basic algorithms that I have already encountered during my studies and will gradually add more difficult ones. This is a long-term and ongoing project.

### Programming Language
Primarily I will use Python. But maybe I will also use Java or Go.
