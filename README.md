# Algorithms collection

This repository contains a collection of algorithms, data structures and programming exercises. With this project I would like to improve my knowledge of algorithms and data structures. I will start to add basic algorithms that I have already encountered during my studies and will gradually add more difficult ones. This is a long-term and ongoing project.
